# Business context

The project focuses on optimizing human resources management in the WAIT team through advanced data analysis. WAIT, for which the project is being implemented, is an open non-profit organization bringing together individuals interested in AI, Data Science and BI issues. Currently, the organization has data on the declared competences of people ready to work in projects, but there is no knowledge about the actual level and development of these skills.

# A problem to solve

The project addresses the problem of ineffective allocation of resources in project management. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that will help improve project team composition through identifying the right people by dividing users into distinguishable groups (clusters).

The aim of the project is to understand the actual state and purpose of the skills of individual WAIT members - monitoring how they develop and whether they are being properly utilized in projects. By identifying characteristics that make certain members more suitable for specific projects, we aim to achieve the following benefits:

# Benefits:

faster identification of suitable candidates for project roles,
better ability to quickly find replacement people when needed,
identification of weak points in WAIT, such as the lack of specialists in specific areas,
determination of possible directions for team training development,
reducing delays and improving project success rates,
identification of skill gaps within the team,
streamlining the recruitment process.


# Machine Learning Method: Clustering

To achieve the project goal, we will apply a machine learning technique known as clustering. It is a method used in exploratory data analysis that allows you to discover hidden structures in data without prior knowledge of labels or categories.

Based on user characteristics and their suitability for specific roles, we aim to achieve a clustered dataset in such a way that items in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to items in other groups.

This method will allow us to identify patterns and relationships and segment people into distinct groups, which will facilitate better assignment to projects.

# Team and Tools

The project is carried out by a three-person team of Master's students of Computer Science in Business as part of the Data Mining course:

Adriana Kuczaj (https://github.com/ada-kuczaj)
Wojciech Maziarz (https://github.com/Wojtini)
Oleksii Karbovskyi (https://github.com/Aleksey9777)

In the project, we use the Python programming language and tools such as pandas and matplotlib libraries for cluster modeling.
